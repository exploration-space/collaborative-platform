   monies & means, & many murdered (after   they had Confessed   their means  ) And the deponent and the rest often affrighted\\n                    with a block and a hatchet which (to put them in more fear) was always left with them as the engins\\n                    of their deaths and the deponent for her own part was thrice hanged up  /to confess moneys and after letten downe, & had the

And\\n                    this deponent further says That\\n                     she this deponent & the wife of Newberry the wife of one\\n                    Prescott  , Susan Stubbs, and   Elizabeth this\\n                    deponent's sole surviving child and about 40 more her fellow prisoners\\n                     \\n                    with their   Convoy from Charlemont   towards Dundalk, the said Owen Roe ô Neill suffered them all to go up & down the Country\\n                    at their pleasures And they hearing of divers apparitions & visions that were ordinarily seen\\n                    near   port a downe bridge since the drowning of her children And\\n                    the rest of the Protestants there and   they being confidently told\\n                    that the said Owen ô Neill & his troops were resolved to be at Portadowne bridge to inform\\n                    themselves concerning those apparitions she this deponent and her child & those other parties\\n                    her companions    at the same time came to Portadowne\\n                    bridge aforesaid   about Candlemas last &   then and there met the said Owen Roe ô Neill & his troop And being all together at the\\n                    waterside there, near the said bridge about twylight in the evening then and there upon a sudden\\n                    there appeared unto them a vision or spirit assuming the shape of a woman waste high   in the water  with elevated 4\\n                 t he n sent duel upon the sight of this deponent and other s prisoners miserably almost\\n                        starved and in this deponent's presence & hearing the his the said Owen ô Neill 4. as before that Ann Stubbs about were C omeing came being women whose husband were murdered & slain C am c min \\n                        to\\n                     the c & child which was there\\n                     upright\\n                     naked 534 & closed hands, her hair disheivelled very white, her eyes seeming to twinckle in her\\n                    head, and her skin as white as snow which spirit or vision seeming to stand straight upright in the\\n                    water divulged and often repeated the word Revenge Revenge Revenge &c Whereat this deponent and\\n                    the rest being put into a strange amazement and fright, walked a little from the place, And then\\n                    presently the said Own Roe ô Neill sent a Roman priest and a friar to speak unto it Whereupon they\\n                    asked questions both in English and Latin, but it answererd them nothing Within a few days after the\\n                    said Owen Roe ô Neill sent his drummer to the English Army for a protestant minister, Who coming to\\n                    him, and being by him desired   to inquire of that vision, or\\n                    spirit what it would have, the same minister went one evening to the usual place on the waterside,\\n                    Where at the like time of the Evening the same or like spirit or vision appeared in the like posture\\n                    and shape as formerly it had done And the same minister saying In the name of the father, the son\\n                    and the holy ghost what wouldest thou have, or for what standest thou there It answered Revenge,\\n                    Revenge, very many times iterating the word Revenge, thereat the same minister went to prayer\\n                    privately and after they all departed, and left the same vision or spirit standing and crying out as\\n                    before, But after that night of six weeks together it neither appeared nor cried any more   that either this deponent or any of the rest (that came thither upon purpose several times)\\n                    could hear or observe yet after six weeks ended it appeared again and cried as before So as the\\n                    Irish that formerly were righted away with it, and which were come again to dwell in the English\\n                    houses thereabouts In hope it would never appear nor cry more, were then so again affrighted that\\n                    they ran quite away and forsook the place the like, or the same spirit or vision since that time\\n                    appearing and crying out Revenge all and every night until this deponent and her child and late\\n                    fellow prisoners came away with their convoy to Dundalk And further says that the first visions or\\n                    apparitions after of But after th at night , of six weeks together , it neither appeared nor\\n                        cried any more ,\\n                     5 535 after the protestants drowned, were in show a great number of heads in the water which\\n                    cried all with a lowd voice Revenge, Revenge &c, as this deponent has been credibly told by the\\n                    Rebels themselves, (who also told this deponent that those apparitions were English Devils) & as\\n                    is most commonly believed and reported by most of the Irish Inhabitants thereabouts And the Rebels\\n                    discharging some shot at those heads, flashes of fire thereat suddenly appeared on the water, as she\\n                    was also credibly told, And that quickly afterwards that shape or spirit   in the likeness of a woman appeared, And cried all and every night beginning about twylight\\n                    as aforesaid And this deponent   further says that in or during the\\n                    time that this deponent was so kept a prisoner she observed and welknew that the said  Captain Manus Can and his wicked and bloody soldiers fetched from\\n                    Armagh one   gentleman and three other singing men of that church, and one   a\\n                    schoolmaster and his wife   minister  , and   a minister (whose wife\\n                    and three young children were starved to death with hunger and cold, and near threescore more\\n                    protestants out of   place where they had formerly imprisoned them and\\n                    forcibly carried  , in her view & (as she was informed by the\\n                    Common report of the Rebels, and by the report of the schoolmaster's wife who went with them and\\n                    returned to this deponent) into the Church of Blackwater, and there sometimes brought their necks to\\n                    the block, threatening to cut their heads with a hatchet to make them confess money at other times\\n                    hanging them up, and at length letting them (half dead) down again, at other times mangling slashing\\n                    and cutting them in the Church, And when as by this barbarous cruelty and other torments, they had\\n                    exacted from them their full confessions of money and gotten it all from them, Then that is to say\\n                    on or about the 17th of November 1641 those barbarous Rebels locked and made all those protestants\\n                    (saving the schoolmasters wife) fast in the said Church, And that done   setting a strong guard about the Church set it in fire and together with that Church burned\\n                    to death all those protestants, Whose cries (being exceeding lowd & fearful the Rebels\\n                 \\n                        B.\\n                     5. d Crispe Simmons Mr Hatton Mr Robinson Mr Spring done mc Griffin a them A\\n                     536 the Rebels (in scornful manner would delight much to imitate & brag of to others, And\\n                    a great number of other protestants especially women and children whom the Rebels could take they\\n                    pricked and stabbed with their pitchforks skenes & swords and would slash mangle and cut them in\\n                    their heads breasts faces Arms hands and other parts of their bodies, but not kill them outright,\\n                    but leave them wallowing in their bloods to languish, pine and starve to death, And when as those so\\n                    mangled people desired them to kill them out of their pain, they would deny it but sometimes (after\\n                    a day or two) they would dash their brains out with stones, or by some other cruel way kill them\\n                    out, which they accounted done as a great favour, Of which she has been in many particulars an\\n                    eyewitness, And when as at Length, the said Manus Can and his soldiers were reproved by Sir Felim ô\\n                    Neill (as this deponent was credibly informed by divers both Rebels and protestants) for so mangling\\n                    and suffering them to Languish, and for suffering the poor women children to li alive sucking their\\n                    mortally wounded & sometimes dead mothers breasts   and not\\n                    killing them outright then the said Manus Can and his barbarous soldiers would suddenly murder such\\n                    protestants as they could after find, and put castle and conceale their murdered bodies in pits\\n                    loghes holes bogs and other obscure places as this deponent was credibly informed that herself saw\\n                    two women so drowned in a well, And further says that the Rebels   did\\n                    burn in several houses within the parishes of Armagh Kilmore and Loughgall a great number of\\n                    protestants at several times not long after the beginning of the Rebellion And drowned great numbers\\n                    of protestants at several times not long after the beginning of the rebellion, And drowned great\\n                    numbers of protestants at Blackwater

bogholes and other places within the County of Armagh aforesaid Neither sparing English Scottish age\\n                    nor sex, unles specially rescued, or else by gods providence taken out of their murderous   hands, And this deponent further says That she heard the said Sir Felim\\n                 e A 6.\\n                     537 o Neill, and divers other Rebels say that by the said Sir Felim was great ô Neill and Earl\\n                    of Tyrone and they that did not call him so should lose their heads And that thence forth there\\n                    never should be any English King of Ireland any more. Howbeit some others of the Rebels privately\\n                    muttered and said amongst themselves that the Lord Maguire (if he had taken Dublin should have   been King of Ireland, And further says that she this deponent was present, when she heard\\n                    the said Owen Roe ô Neill ask the Rebels how many protestants they had drowned at the bridge of\\n                    Portadowne aforesaid they answered four hundred, And he asked further how many they had drowned at\\n                    Blackwater, They answered they had drowned so many there at 5 or 6 several times that they could not\\n                    tell their numbers, And confessed that they had drowned others in divers loughes pitts bogs holes\\n                    & places, and at so many several times that they Knew not nor could guess at their numbers   And says further that it was commonly reported by the Rebels themselves, that they took an\\n                    Englishwoman near the bridge of Portadowne (by name, the wife of   when she was great\\n                    with child, And that they ripped up her belly so that the child fell out of her womb, And then they\\n                    threw both the mother and the child into the water, And this deponent further says that when as\\n                    divers of the English were about to be murdered, and desired the Rebels upon their knees first to\\n                    admit them to make their prayers to God, The Rebels have often in her the deponents hearing in Irish\\n                    words answered and said Cuir d anim in diouall, which in English is Give or bequeath thy soul to the\\n                    Devil, And at other times would say to the protestants (upon their knees, begging with tears, that\\n                    they might pray before their deaths) Why should you pray for your soul is with the Devil already,\\n                    And thereupon and with those words in their mouths would slaughter and put them to death, And she\\n                    often heard the Common sort of Rebels say, that when they had destroyed all the English in Ireland\\n                    they would go with an Army into England and destroy the English there, And the deponent has still\\n                    observed the Irish Rebellious women   more\\n                 7.
